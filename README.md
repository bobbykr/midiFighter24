Firmware and tools for Arduino based 24 buttons midi controller

see it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FosVgqp6nJg)

You can also have a look to my [MF60 project](https://github.com/cstoquer/MF60) which is a 60 buttons upgraded version of this project. This is still a work in progress but the code might be a bit cleaner...

## Setup Arduino to send Midi via USB

Install DualMocoLUFA on the Arduino 8U2's chip
(look inside the `dualMocoLUFA` folder in this repository to find code and instructions)
